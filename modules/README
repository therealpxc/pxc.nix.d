Confused about the syntax of this section? Modules are a special and simple
NixOS facility for modular configuration. It is possible to have a complete
system configuration without them, even one that is split out across multiple
source files. However, experimenting with NixOS modules helps prepare one for
NixOS development, and adds some flexibility in configuration by making the
configuration an object of reference within the configuration in a sane way.

Modules use a simple and limited syntax, as follows:

{
  imports = [
    # list of path to other modules.
  ];

  options = {
    # attribute set of option declarations.
  };

  config = {
    # attribute set of option definitions.
  };
}

Alternatively, if they have no options to declare, they can be specified like
this:

{
  require = [
    # list of path to other modules.
  ];

  # attribute set of option definitions.
}
