# Dashes
# ======

# A quick recap on hyphens and dashes:
#
# • U002D «-» is the ASCII hyphen‐minus.  It is overloaded as hyphen,
#   dash, and minus sign at the command‐line, programming languages,
#   and in software that can’t handle Unicode well.
# • U2010 «‐» is the true hyphen.  Use it as the grammatical hyphen
#   when you feel typographical.
# • U2011 «‑» is the non‐breaking hyphen.  It is visually identical
#   to the true hyphen, but tells software they shouldn’t break a line
#   at this point.  This is useful whenever you feel like an
#   hyphenated word musn’t be separated in different lines — for
#   example, when a broken hyphenated word could be mistaken by a
#   non‐hyphenated word (e.g. “re‑creation”, if broken, could be taken
#   as “recreation”).
# • U2012 «‒» is the figure dash.  “Figure” here refers to numbers,
#   and this dash is guaranteed to be the same width as a digit (in
#   fonts with equal‐width digits) so they line up.  This dash
#   therefore is to be used with digits, as in telephone numbers or
#   postal codes.  Don’t use it for mathematical operations (for which
#   there is the minus sign) or ranges (for which the en‐dash is
#   best).  See also U2007, the figure space.
# • U2013 «–» is the en‐dash — that is, a dash with roughly the
#   width of an uppercase N.  It’s kind of a softer (and smaller)
#   version of the em‐dash.  Its main uses are ranges (“2–10”,
#   “Jan–Mar”) and as a further separator for hyphenated words
#   (“un‐american–like”).  In a pinch, some people use two ASCII
#   hyphen‐minuses to substitute it.
# • U2014 «—» is the em‐dash — the dash that is roughly the width of
#   an uppercase M, which is usually the maximum type width.  This is
#   the one used to make parenthetical remarks — like this — or
#   dangling clauses — like this.  Use it a lot if you’re a beatnik.
#   In a pinch, many people use two or three ASCII hyphen‐minuses to
#   substitute it.  Traditionally the em‐dash is used without
#   spaces—like this—but this looks bad in monospace fonts (only).
# • U2015 «―» is the horizontal bar.  It’s the official character to
#   use in dialogues.  It’s identical to the em‐dash in most fonts, so
#   many just use the em‐dash instead.
# • U2212 «−» is the true minus sign.  It is more visible and
#   better‐spaced than the ASCII hyphen‐minus, particularly with
#   proportional fonts (generally its size and positioning will match
#   +, × and other mathematical operators).
#
# All of the above look basically the same in most monospaced fonts.
# Their true typographical beauty shows up in real texts, not in
# conffiles.
#
# • U00AD «­» is the soft hyphen.  This is an invisible control
#   character in Unicode; its purpose is to mark what points of a word
#   can be broken for hyphenation and aid in automatic text layout.
#   However, it was visible in ISO-8859-1, where it served to mark
#   points where words _were_ broken by algorithms; thus some software
#   still render it as a regular hyphen.  See
#   http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/shy.html .
# • U2053 «⁓» is the swung dash (not a tilde like «~» ascii tilde or
#   « ̃» combining tilde).  A swung dash is often used to substitute
#   words, as in dictionaries.  It overlaps with CJK wave dash U301C
#   «〜» and wavy dash U3030 «〰», which are probably better for
#   full-width contexts (see cjk.xcompose).  Other CJK dashes are «゠»
#   and «－».
# • U2027 «‧» is the hyphenation point.  Also commonly seen in
#   dictionaries (dic‧tion‧ar‧ies).  Not to be confused with the
#   middle dot U00B7 · nor the katakana middle dot (・).
